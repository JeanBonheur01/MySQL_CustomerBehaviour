### Questions And Queries

1. What is the total amount spent by each customer?



2. How many days does each customer visit the restaurant?
   
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

   
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?


5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?


6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?


7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?


8. What are the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?


9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier, how many points would each customer have?


10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customers A and B have at the end of April?
The company also requires the ranking of products. The ranking of non-member purchases is not needed; it should be NULL for customers who are not yet part of the loyalty program.
